## 📝 TL;DR
- To push forward general robotic grasping, we introduce a large-scale reasoning-based affordance segmentation benchmark, **RAGNet**.  It contains 273k images, 180 categories, and 26k reasoning instructions. 
- Furthermore, we propose a comprehensive affordance-based grasping framework, named AffordanceNet, which consists of a VLM (named AffordanceVLM) pre-trained on our massive affordance data and a grasping network that conditions an affordance map to grasp the target.
